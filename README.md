# binary-style
Style system and guide for Binary.com

You can see the [Live Style Guide](https://style.binary.com/)

The goal of the project is to serve as base style for all Binary projects, and to ensure consistency and maintainability of the brand presentation.

### Usage

Include the styles by including this file as your first style resource:

```
https://style.binary.com/binary.css
```

Then include any app-specific styles.

For already existing apps, please remove any styles that override the base ones.

### Customizability

There is an official [Dark theme](https://style.binary.com/inverse)

Just add 'inverse' class to an html tag and it and all its children will now be styled as light elements on dark background.
